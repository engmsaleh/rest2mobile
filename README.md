Magnet rest2mobile generates native code for mobile apps from REST-JSON APIs. It turns actual REST requests and responses into source code (Objective-C, Android, and JavaScript) that you can call from your mobile app. The source code automatically handles:

* server connections
* marshaling and unmarshaling JSON data
* JSON data conversion to the correct data types

In your mobile app code, you call generated methods type-safe entities and will receive a response object.

To use Magnet rest2mobile, download the rest2mobile plugins for [Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-plugin-android/) or [XCode](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-plugin-ios/). For JavaScript, you can use the [r2m CLI](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-cli/) to generate the code.
