Magnet rest2mobile generates native code for mobile apps from REST-JSON APIs. It turns actual REST requests and responses into source code (Objective-C, Android, and JavaScript) that you can call from your mobile app. The source code automatically handles:

* server connections
* marshaling and unmarshaling JSON data
* JSON data conversion to the correct data types

In your mobile app code, you call generated methods type-safe entities and will receive a response object.
