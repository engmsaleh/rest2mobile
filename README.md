# Magnet rest2mobile

Magnet rest2mobile turns actual REST URLs and JSON responses into Objective-C, Java, or JavaScript components that you can call from your mobile app. The components are native classes and interfaces that automatically handle server connections and type safety. In your own code, you call methods to set REST parameters and send the REST request. Your app receives a response object that bundles the JSON in objects or primitives.

To use Magnet rest2mobile, download the rest2mobile plugins for [Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-plugin-android/) or [XCode](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-plugin-ios/). For JavaScript, you can use the [r2m CLI](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-cli/) to generate the code.

Once you have generate the native code using the plugin or the CLI, make sure you have installed the rest2mobile SDK for your platform before building your app:

* [rest2mobile SDK for Android](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-sdk-android/)
* [rest2mobile SDK for iOS](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-sdk-ios/)
* [rest2mobile SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/magnetsystems/r2m-sdk-js/)
